 ## PicCap - Hyperion Sender App  
 The idea is to have an ambilight on our LG webOS TVs like it's known from Philipps TVs.  
 ![Ambilight preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51515147/192122007-3eea4750-204c-445f-84f9-35062554ba19.jpg)
 
 ### PicCap?
 PicCap is an frontend app, which you can install on your TV, to make TV content capturing as easy as possible. It ships and controls the seperated [hyperion-webos](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos) background native service, which uses capture interfaces on your TV based on reverse engineering, proccesses the output and sends as result a low quality image to a receiver like Hyperion's flatbuffer server.

 ### Hyperion?  
 [hyperion.ng](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) basicly is a server service, which transforms incomming image data to an LED output. - Also available in Homebrew Channel!  
   
 ### Features  
 - webOS 3.4+ support 
 - Log gathering for app and hyperion-webos  
 - Status refreshing to display some useful info like FPS or used backends  
 - Button and magic remote navigation  
 - Switch between dark, grey or blue UI  
   
 ### What do you need?  
 - [Root access](https://github.com/RootMyTV/RootMyTV.github.io) to your TV  
 - webOS 3.4 or above  
 - Latest version of [Homebrew Channel](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel) installed, as we take use of its elevate-service script  
 - Brain with some basic knowledge - We haven't encountered any bricks, but standard no warranty clause applies  
   
 ## How to use
 ### First start  
 Wait a few secounds to let the service elevate root permissions through Homebrew Channel-Service. Check status message in bottom right corner, to see when it's done.
   
 ### Settings 
  - If you use hyperion.ng or HyperHDR loader, you will have to fill `127.0.0.1` as IP address. 
  - Change priority if you have other capture or effect sources for your Hyperion or HyperHDR instance.   
   
 ### Backends
 We use different libraries to capture TVs content. These are used by hyperion-webos and described [here](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos/tree/main#backends).  
   
 ### Advanced settings
 Some TV models are comptabile with a specific backend, but require a slightly different routine to work reliably. You can find an explaination for  these so called quirks [here](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos/tree/main#quirks).  
   
 ### DRM-protected content  
 On newer TVs there is no official way for capturing DRM-protected content like from Netflix or Amazon. This restriction doesn't take place for content comming from an HDMI input.  
 So currently as a workaround you can play your media using your PC, FireTV-Stick or Chromecast and still enjoy your LEDs.
