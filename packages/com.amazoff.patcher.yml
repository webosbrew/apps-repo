  **AmazOff** is an IPK application for **rooted LG webOS TVs**. It extends the Amazon Prime Video Player with following patches applied:
  - Remove Ads (Pre-, Mid- and Endrolls)
  - Suppress telemetry
  
  As a result, all launch paths—including the **remote control’s dedicated Amazon button**—will open the modified version.
  
  ## Status
  
  - **Development stage:** early / experimental  
  - **Tested on:** webOS 3.x, webOS 4.x, webOS 6.5, webOS 9.x
  - **Amazon app variants:** 4.1.15, 6.3.38, 1.1.121
  
  ## WebOS < 4.0
  
  On WebOS prior to 4.0 the No-Ads patch only removes loaded Ads. 
  Pre-Rolls from prime themself are still embedded into the stream, but can be fast-forwarded out of.
  
  ## Usage
  
  1. Launch **AmazOff**
  2. Run **Start Service**
  3. **Optional**: Enable Autostart
  4. **Launch Target App**: Launch the Amazon Prime Video App.
  
  Notes:
  - A successful patch is confirmed by a **toast notification** when the Amazon app is launched (Only WebOS > 4.0).
  - If the service cant be started you can check for possible fault in the **Details** page.
  
  ## Development Notes
  
  Within the folder **development** you can find the applied patches to the player resources. It also contains a setup script for development as well as a script how the dev-version was then packed. Feel free to PR additional patches.
