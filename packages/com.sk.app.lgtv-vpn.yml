  # lgtv-vpn
  A small LG webOS TV app that wraps an OpenVPN client so you can start and stop VPN connections directly from your TV without an external router or device.

  ## What the app does
  - Uses the bundled OpenVPN binary to start a VPN connection on your LG TV.
  - Talks to the Homebrew Channel service to run OpenVPN in the background and manage its lifecycle.
  - Provides a simple on-device UI to connect, disconnect, and view connection status.
  - The VPN connection is kept even when switching apps. So Youtube / Netflix etc. is also running through the VPN connection.
